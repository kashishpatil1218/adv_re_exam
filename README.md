   Ensure you have Flutter installed, then run:  
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set Up API**  
   Replace the placeholder API URL in `lib/services/api_service.dart` with your backend endpoint.

4. **Run the App**  
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Configuration
- **API Service**:  
  All API calls are handled in `lib/services/api_service.dart`. Use the `dio` or `http` package for network requests.  
- **Shared Preferences**:  
  Local storage (e.g., user tokens, cart items) is implemented in `lib/services/shared_preferences_service.dart`.
- **Provider**:  
  State management is implemented via `lib/providers/`. Update or add new providers as needed for additional functionality.
